/**
 * Which platform_credentials row means what:
 *
 *   platform='hevy'          the API key, written by the setup form
 *   platform='garmin'        the Garmin email/password pair, written by the Python setup form only
 *   platform='garmin_tokens' the DI tokens, written by every Garmin login (Python and web)
 *
 * Garmin connectivity has to come from `garmin_tokens`. A web login writes only that row, so
 * pages that looked at `garmin` reported a working login as "Not connected" and stayed that way
 * until the user hand-copied the row (hevy2garmin#495).
 *
 * It also has to come from the stored token rather than the `status` column. DBTokenStore's
 * upsert sets status='active' on INSERT but not in its DO UPDATE branch, so a row first created
 * by anything else keeps the schema default 'disconnected' through every later login. Reading the
 * token itself is true whenever a sync would actually work, which is what the badge claims.
 *
 * Both token shapes count: 0.3+ nests the DI payload under `garmin_tokens`, older Python logins
 * wrote it flat. healGarminTokenRow migrates a flat row, but only during a sync.
